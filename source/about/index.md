Hi! I'm Allan Mogusu, a software engineer from Kenya with 3 years of experience building production-grade applications. On this blog, I write about the following, in no particular order:

* JavaScript, its features and design patterns
* Testing JavaScript & TypeScript applications
* Back-end Development with Python(Flask and Django)
* Front-end Development with React and Vue.
* DevOps

I also write for another blog, [Stack Abuse](https://stackabuse.com/author/allan/).
